= Maven project structure for FSW applications with ear deployments
This project shows the basic structure for a FSW application consisting of:

* A jboss module (this will hold beans and common classes for multiple applications)
* Applications (appA, .... these will be .ear applications with multiple switchyard composites, and maybe some common classes to the ear)
* A distribution (this will hold everything that needs to be deployed to the server (the module in modules, and the .ear files in standalone/deployments)

If you are going to start a new project, this can be used as a template, as it is proved to work.
